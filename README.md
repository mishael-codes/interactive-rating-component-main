## Acknowledgments

I had trouble with selecting a specific rating but going through and selecting a rating. But with the help of [TsbSankara](https://tsbsankara.netlify.app)'s solution, I saw how to go about it using the :focus pseudo class selector and adding a click event to each of them using the forEach() method.
